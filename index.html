          Adding more fresh produce to your diet is highly recommended since
          fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants
          that are essential for maintaining good overall health, weight
          management, and even healthy weight loss. According to Jaclyn London,
          R.D., a nutrition consultant, including more fruits in your diet is
          one of the best ways to make nutritious food choices that can help
          boost your mood, reduce the risk of heart disease, obesity, and type 2
          diabetes, and increase your overall lifespan. Fruits are also
          essential for supporting good digestion due to their high fibre
          content, promoting strong immunity, proper hydration, and energy
          levels. However, only 10% of Americans consume enough fruits to meet
          their daily recommended intake, which is about 1½ to 2 cups daily,
          according to the

          >Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</a
        >
        <p>
          A simple way to increase your fruit and vegetable intake is to eat a
          variety of colourful fruits each day. You can group fruits by their
          pigment, such as green, yellow, orange, red, and purple, to ensure you
          consume a variety of fruits. Even if you're already a fruit lover, try
          incorporating some unfamiliar fruits into your diet for added variety
          and benefits!

          The garden strawberry is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus
          Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated
          worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its
          characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness.
          It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared
          foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates.
          Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in
          products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others. The
          garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via
          a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria
          chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in
          1714.Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial
          production, the woodland strawberry, which was the first strawberry
          species cultivated in the early 17th century.From a botanical point of
          view, the strawberry is not a berry but an aggregate accessory fruit,
          meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries
          but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries. Each apparent "seed"on
          the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower,
          with a seed inside it.

          Strawberries produce flowers that in turn bear fruit. The yellow
          center of each little flower is actually where the plant is
          pollinated. Once pollinated, the flower petals fall off and the yellow
          center starts to grow and becomes a strawberry. Each strawberry branch
          (also known as “flower truss”) has three to eight flowers if you’re
          really lucky. Strawberries produce flowers that in turn bear fruit.

          really lucky. The king fruit is the first berry to grow and will be
          the first one that farmers pick. It is also the biggest berry. People
          in Ontario often note that strawberry size can really vary. Unlike
          imported berries, these strawberries actually change size as they
          develop. They put the most energy into the first berry (the king
          berry) and so that strawberry is going to be the biggest but the
          berries do get a bit smaller as the season goes on. As pickers go
          through, they sort the strawberries into packages by size.

          Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is not only one of the most important and
          popular fruits in Bangladesh, but it is also a beloved fruit
          worldwide. It is often referred to as the "king of fruits" because of
          its excellent overall eating characteristics, sweet and tangy flavour,
          and versatility in culinary applications. Mango is consumed as a fresh
          fruit, in frozen, preserved or dried forms, or is processed into
          juices, purees, chutneys, and pickles. Ripe mangoes are best eaten as
          fresh fruit, usually as a dessert, but they are also used in the
          production of confectionery, ice cream, and bakery products. In
          addition to its delicious taste, mango contains a variety of
          phytochemicals and nutrients that make it a highly nutritious fruit.
          The fruit pulp is high in dietary fibre, Vitamin C, provitamin A,
          carotenoids, and diverse polyphenols. The dietary fibre in mango helps

          Mango trees are a favourite among gardeners and farmers alike, as they
          are relatively easy to grow and produce delicious fruit. If you're
          interested in growing your mango trees, there are a few different
          methods you can try. One common way to start a mango tree is by
          planting a seed or purchasing a grafted nursery tree. Another option
          is to take cuttings from an existing tree and root them yourself.
          While cuttings may not always result in a strong root system, they are
          a cost-effective way to propagate new trees. Once your mango tree is
          established, it's important to know when to harvest the fruit. Mangoes
          are typically harvested by hand-picking when they reach maturity,
          using long poles with a hook or basket attached to gather the fruit
          from the tree. The timing of harvest will depend on the variety of
          mangoes and local conditions, with growers aiming for optimal
          ripeness. After the fruit is harvested, it goes through a sorting,
          cleaning, and packaging process to prepare it for distribution. In
          addition to being a tasty treat, mangoes are also packed with health
          benefits. They are rich in vitamins A and C, as well as potassium and
          fibre. So not only can you enjoy the delicious taste of fresh mangoes,
          but you can also feel good about incorporating them into your diet.

        <h2 id="about3">About</h2>

        <p>
          Kiwi is a small, oval-shaped fruit with brown fuzzy skin and a bright
          green interior flesh that is dotted with tiny black seeds. Despite its
          diminutive size, kiwi fruit packs a lot of punch when it comes to
          flavour and nutrition. These fruits have a unique, tangy-sweet flavour
          that is both refreshing and invigorating. They are also an excellent
          source of vitamins C and K, potassium, fibre, and antioxidants.
          Originally known as the Chinese gooseberry, kiwi was first cultivated
          in northern China where it was primarily used for medicinal purposes.
          It wasn't until the early 20th century that kiwi began to spread from
          China to other parts of the world, including New Zealand, where it
          became a popular crop. New Zealand is now one of the world's leading
          producers of kiwi fruit. Kiwi fruit is incredibly versatile and can be
          enjoyed in a variety of ways. Some people prefer to eat kiwi fresh,
          slicing it in half and scooping out the flesh with a spoon. Others
          enjoy it in salads, smoothies, juices, or as a topping on yogurt or
          oatmeal. Kiwi is also commonly used in desserts such as cakes, tarts,
          and pies. Whether you're looking to add more nutrition to your diet or
          simply want to enjoy a delicious and refreshing fruit, kiwi is worth
          considering. So, next time you're at the grocery store, be sure to
          grab a few of these little green gems and add them to your cart!
        </p>
        <h2 id="cultivation3">Cultivation</h2>

        <p>
          Did you know that kiwi fruit is not actually native to New Zealand, as
          many people believe? In fact, kiwi fruit is native to China, where it
          was originally known as Chinese gooseberry. It wasn't until the 20th
          century that the fruit was brought to New Zealand and renamed
          kiwifruit, after the country's national bird, the kiwi. Kiwi fruit is
          a fascinating plant to grow. It grows on a vine and requires a
          horizontal wire trellis system for support. The vines are trained onto
          the trellis, which helps to keep the fruit off the ground and make
          harvesting easier. Each individual kiwi plant bears either male or
          female flowers, and to ensure proper production, one male vine must be
          planted to every 8 female vines. This ratio ensures that there is
          enough pollen to go around and that the female plants are properly
          pollinated. Interestingly, kiwifruit is not self-pollinating, which
          means that bees are required for proper pollination. When the bees
          visit the flowers, they transfer pollen from the male flowers to the
          female flowers, which allows the fruit to develop. Without bees, kiwi
          fruit production would be severely limited. In addition to being
          delicious, kiwi fruit is also packed with nutrients. It is high in
          vitamin C, vitamin K, and potassium, and is also a good source of
          dietary fiber. So not only is kiwifruit a fun plant to grow, it's also
          a healthy addition to your diet.

          Blueberries are a popular fruit that are loved by many for their
          plump, sweet and juicy flavor. They come in a variety of colors
          ranging from indigo to deep purple, and are considered to be a
          superfood due to their high nutrient content. Interestingly, wild
          blueberries are indigenous to North America and have been a part of
          the continent's ecosystem for more than 13,000 years. However,
          blueberries did not become a cultivated crop until the early 20th
          century when a New Jersey farmer's daughter teamed up with a botanist
          to cultivate and breed the fruit. The first blueberries were harvested
          in 1916, and over the next 50 years, there was a "blueberry boom"
          across America. Today, blueberries are grown in various parts of North
          America, with the continent producing approximately 1 billion pounds
          of blueberries each year. Apart from North America, blueberries are
          also cultivated in parts of South America, including Argentina, Chile,
          and Peru. They are a versatile fruit that can be used in a variety of
          recipes, from pies and muffins to smoothies and salads. With their
          sweet and tangy flavor, blueberries are a delicious and healthy
          addition to any diet.

          Blueberries are a delicious and healthy fruit, packed with
          antioxidants and nutrients. These little berries grow on tall bushes
          that are usually planted in long rows in order to maximize their
          production. The process of growing blueberries is a long and
          meticulous one. Farmers must wait for 3-4 years after planting the
          young bush until it becomes mature and ready to be harvested. During
          this time, they need to ensure that the soil is well-drained and
          acidic, and that the plant receives plenty of water and sunlight. Once
          mature, the blueberry bush can continue to produce fruit for up to 30
          years! That's a long time, and it's one of the reasons why blueberries
          are such a popular crop among farmers. However, it's important to note
          that the yield of the bush tends to decline after the first 10-12
          years of growth, so farmers need to be careful about when to replant
          or remove old bushes. Another interesting fact about blueberry bushes
          is that they can grow up to 12 feet tall! That's taller than most
          people! However, most blueberry bushes top out at around six feet,
          which is still pretty impressive. In order to keep the bushes at a
          manageable height, farmers prune them regularly and use various
          techniques to promote healthy growth.All in all, blueberries are a
          fascinating crop that requires patience and care to grow successfully.
          But the end result is worth it – sweet and juicy berries that are
          beloved by people all over the world.

          One simple way to enjoy more fruits is to make a fruit salad by
          combining different types of fruits in a bowl and tossing them
          together. You can also add some nuts, seeds, or a drizzle of honey for
          added flavour and nutrition. Smoothies are another great way to
          incorporate more fruits into your diet. Simply blend your favourite
          fruits with some milk or yogurt, and enjoy a refreshing and nutritious
          drink. If you have a sweet tooth, try making a fruit-based dessert
          such as a fruit tart, fruit sorbet, or grilled fruit skewers. These
          desserts are not only delicious but also nutritious and low in
          calories. Instead of reaching for a sugary snack, try snacking on some
          fresh fruits. Fruits like apples, bananas, and oranges are easy to
          carry and make a great on-the-go snack. If you're looking for a
          healthy breakfast option, try adding some fresh fruits to your oatmeal
          or cereal bowl. This will add some natural sweetness and a variety of
          nutrients to your breakfast. Fruits can also be used as a natural
          sweetener in recipes. For example, you can use mashed bananas or
          unsweetened applesauce instead of sugar in baking recipes. Remember to
          always wash your fruits before consuming them and to choose organic
          fruits whenever possible to avoid pesticides and chemicals.
